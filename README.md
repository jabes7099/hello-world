# hello-world
This is the description for hello-world.

I like fine beverages and herbs. The biggest interest to me is learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
Im looking forward to diving into the world of programming and seeing if front-end, back-end, or full-stack will be of any interest to me.

The biggest step into freedom is knowing yourself. I am someone who likes immediate feedback on how I do, and coding might be the ticket to a more fulfilling career.
